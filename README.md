Hey there! I'm Taylor Stuart!

I am a Strategy and Analytics Manager at Vivint SmartHome. I´m based in Provo, UT.

Since 2015 I've been gaining experience in both consultative and operational analytics. I've developed skills in R, Python, SQL, and Tableau for use in both statistics and machine learning.

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

I'm working to improve my skills in statistical methods, machine learning, and data visualization. See my [Github Page](https://tstuart8.github.io)
